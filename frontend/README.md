# 🌐 Dharma API – Frontend (Testing App)

This is a simple React + Tailwind application used to test the Dharma API.

It is not meant to be a production UI.
It is a development testing ground for API integration.

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- React (Vite)
- Tailwind CSS
- Fetch API

---

## 📂 Folder Structure

```
frontend/
│
├── src/
├── public/
├── index.html
├── package.json
└── vite.config.js
```

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

---

### 2️⃣ Start development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Frontend will run at:

```
http://localhost:5173
```

---

## 🔌 Connecting to Backend

The frontend expects the backend API to run locally:

```
http://localhost:5000
```

If backend port changes, update API base URL in:

```
src/
```

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This App

- Test API endpoints
- Validate JSON structure
- Display sample deity data
- Experiment with UI ideas

---

## 📦 Future Enhancements

- Deity list view
- Deity detail page
- Sloka display component
- Temple map integration
- Dark mode toggle

---

## 🧘 Notes

This frontend is intentionally lightweight.
Main goal is API validation, not UI perfection.
